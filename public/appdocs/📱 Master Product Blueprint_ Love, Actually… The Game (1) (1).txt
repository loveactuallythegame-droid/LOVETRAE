📱 Master Product Blueprint: Love, Actually… The Game
App Tagline: "How About We DON’T Break Up?"
Core Concept: A mobile-first, gamified couples therapy app hosted by a sarcastic AI (Dr. Marcie Liss) that turns relationship repair into a competitive, witty, and deeply healing game.


1. Brand & Design System (Disney-Level Polish)
Visual Identity: High-fidelity, vibrant, "Glam Noir" meets "Candy Crush." It must feel like a game, not a clinic.
🎨 Color Palette
* Primary Accent (Romance Pink): #FA1F63 (Buttons, gradients, emotional highlights).
* Primary Purple (Deep Royal): #5C1459 (Headers, Branding, Dr. Marcie’s outfit).
* Secondary Violet: #BE1980 (Gradients, secondary interactions).
* Mint Green (Success/Safe): #33DEA5 (Success states, "Green flags").
* Gold/Yellow (Warning/Highlight): #E4E831 (Warnings, star ratings, electric energy).
* Backgrounds: Dark Mode default using deep radial gradients (e.g., #120016 to #5C1459)2.
🔤 Typography
* Headers/Titles: Barbie Dream Regular (Playful, bold).
* Body Text: Cheese Regular (Readable but stylized) or Nunito Sans for long text4.

* Dr. Marcie’s Sass: Sweet Pink Regular (Script style for commentary).
* Important Keywords: Wonderful Sometimes Regular.
✨ Dr. Marcie Liss (Visual Logic)
* Character: Image in brandboard
* Placement Rule: Dr. Marcie is never confined to a box. She is an overlay character who walks over text, leans against input fields, and interacts with the UI elements directly (e.g., holding the timer, pointing at the "Submit" button).
* Animation: High-quality idle animations (checking her nails, rolling eyes, tapping her clipboard) while the user is thinking.

3. 🧙‍♀️ Dr. Marcie Liss: The AI Host
Visual Behavior (The "Overlay" Mechanic):
* No Boxes: Dr. Marcie is never confined to a square profile picture. She is a full-body or half-body character overlay who "walks" over text and leans against UI elements3.
* Interaction: She interacts physically with the screen (e.g., tapping her watch if you are slow, pointing at the "Submit" button).
* Personality: Sarcastic, brutally honest, stylish (1950s noir meets modern glam).
The 4 Personality Levels (Sarcasm Engine)
Configurable in Settings or adaptive based on resilience. 444444444
1. The 4 Personality Levels (Sarcasm Engine): (User toggles in Settings)
* Level 1: Truth Wizard: Deep, poetic, searing truth. (Sample: "You’re not broken, but you are bleeding on the carpet. Stop searching for closure in open wounds and start stitching.")
* Level 2: Tough Love Rookie: Blunt, warm, straight-talking. (Sample: "Honey, if ignoring red flags was an Olympic sport, you’d have the gold medal by now. Fix it.")
* Level 3: Reality Check Specialist: Clinical, analytical, detached sarcasm. (Sample: "Your attachment style is showing. Loudly. Fascinating how you mistake 'avoidance' for 'independence'.")
* Level 4: The Marcie Max (The \"All of the Above\" Energy)   A dynamic synthesis of Levels 1-3. Marcie shifts between Blunt, Clinical, and Searing Truth  depending on the emotional intensity and distortion detected by the AI. This is the most complex, high-risk, high-reward mode.
